	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		SI 622 is a project-based course that students should work with a business client
		during the whole semester. My team worked with <a href="https://pilot.ly/">Pilot.ly</a>, a
		start-up company which services video streaming of TV shows. It provides pilot episodes
		before the TV show goes on air, receiving feedback from viewers and analyzing it for
		the content provider.

		Survey
	</div>
	
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		In order to help develop their product, our team designed a survey that addressed 
		their target audience. We sought to identify attitudes and behaviors about online 
		streaming in order to develop recommendations that can be implemented into Pilot.ly’s 
		platform.

		<br><br>
		
		Our findings thus center on these 3 major themes of feedback. These findings include:
		<li>Video content is essential to motivating users to rate, comment and/or review on a website</li>
		<li>Altruism and social engagement motivates users to respond to surveys while rewards do not</li>
		<li>Our two survey groups respond differently to the product; the existing database responds more 
		positively to Pilot.ly while those out of the Pilot.ly database have a more neutral approach</li>
		<br>
		With these findings, our team has created a series of corresponding recommendations. These recommendations include:
		<br>
		<li>Engaging users with existing comments/reviews/ratings around the content in order to perpetuate exchange in feedback</li>
		<li>Developing a rating system in addition to comments and/or reviews</li>
		<li>Appealing primarily to the social and altruistic nature of the user while approaching rewards in a secondary manner</li>
		<li>Encouraging current Pilot.ly users to extend to more general audiences while also creating options that appeal to both parties</li>

		Interview
	</div>
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		We gathered several insights into the motivations and values of Pilot.ly’s future users. 
		Our key findings include that most interviewees do not appreciate interruptions during 
		their viewing experience and that accessibility, convenience and flexibility are important 
		factors in watching a TV series. Additionally, most interviewees expressed willingness to 
		provide quick feedback to surveys and stressed the importance of understanding the purpose
		/intention of a survey before they fill it out.

		Comparative Analysis
	</div>

	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		We compared Pilot.ly with several competitors that offer online streaming services. A total
		 of 6 competitors (Amazon Prime Instant Video Originals, Hulu Plus, Netflix, HBO GO, CBS, 
		 and Vudu) compiled between Pilot.ly and our team were chosen and evaluated under several 
		 different categories and key dimensions. Together, our team analyzed and discussed our data 
		 and research to create a matrix that compares Pilot.ly to other competitors. 
		<br><br>
		 We created 5 
		 recommendations that Pilot.ly can take into consideration to further improve their website.
		  These recommendations include: 1) featuring a search bar in order to ease a user’s browsing
		   experience, 2) incorporate a rating system that allows user to leave quick, easy feedback, 
		   3) replace the current DISQUS widget with Facebook to enhance the user commenting process,
		    4) incorporate a sharing function in the video player or have it accessible during video 
		    play, and 5) include a caption feature in the video player to include audiences who require
		     subtitles or have a disability.

		Usability Test
	</div>
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		5 testers and 1 pilot tester were recruited from the Ann Arbor area to complete 7 tasks 
		that our team designed. We sought to understand how users perceive the site and determine 
		any sort of issues that they encountered.
		<br><br>
		<h4> Sample and Recruit</h4>

		The primary target user group of Pilot.ly consists of young professionals and college 
		students. These users should be active TV watchers, be tech-savvy, and consider themselves 
		social media pioneers. However, this website is designed for general users who watch TV 
		regardless of age, tech adoption, and social media involvement. Considering our recruit 
		flexibility, we used the following criterion to select our subjects:
		<br><br>
		<li>Balanced gender in sample group</li>
		<li>Aged 18-30</li>
		<li>Students and young professionals</li>
		<li>Watches more than 1 hour of TV per week</li>
		<li>Has streaming platform experience</li>
		<li>No experience using Pilot.ly</li>
		<br><br>

		<h4>Test design</h4>
		After acknowledging Pilot.ly’s key features with our client, we designed a protocol draft, 7 tasks, several follow up questions, and a pre-test and post-test questionnaire within our team. All tasks and follow up questions were designed to examine essential features in-site (see Appendix Protocol and Questionnaire). These essential features include:
		<br><br>

		<li>User on-boarding process (sign-up, sign-in, and tutorial)</li>
		<li>Browsing and finding pilot shows</li>
		<li>Watching shows</li>
		<li>Commenting</li>
		<li>Sharing</li>
		<li>Changing password in Profile page</li>
		<li>My Library page</li>
		<br><br>

		<h4>Analysis process</h4>	 
		After completing 5 usability tests, we reviewed and organized all notes for each user. We 
		discussed and combined our findings for all 7 tasks together, covering how each problem 
		occurred, how many subjects experienced that same problem, and then ranked that problem’s 
		severity. Issues ranked level 4 severity were listed in the Findings section of this report 
		while issues with severity levels 0-3 are located in the Appendix. We also acknowledged 
		issues pertinent to Pilot.ly but not purely usability issues in the Discussion section. The 
		same Nielsen severity scale used in our Heuristic Evaluation report was used in this 
		Usability report.

		</div>
		<br><br>
		The most severe issues include:
 
		<li>Users cannot find a search function and indicate its necessity to find the programs they want</li>
		<li>Users perceive “Watch Now” and “Add to my Library” as 2 separate concepts and do not understand why they are located in the same button</li>
		<li>Users have difficulty maneuvering through the website</li>
		<li>Users have difficulty controlling the DISQUS commenting widget</li>
		<li>Users who utilize Facebook login cannot comment successfully on TV programs</li>
		<li>Users cannot change their password successfully in their profiles</li>

		Conclusion
	</div>
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		This usability test report concludes our research for the Pilot.ly platform. We have 
		completed an interaction map, interviews &amp personas, a survey evaluation, a competitive 
		analysis, a heuristic evaluation, and now usability testing. The data that we analyzed in 
		each report can be used to help enhance Pilot.ly’s streaming service before their commercial
		 launch. 
		<br><br>
		We created a video to effectively describe problems and potential oppportunities of Pilot.ly
		as our final result.<br><br>
