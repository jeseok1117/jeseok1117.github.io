		In this paper, I redesigned a white cane into TalkingCane, an 
		interactive instrument for communication between visually impaired 
		people and the world. The research goal is to facilitate bus usage 
		by blind people and hence increase their ability to exercise their 
		essential right of accessibility in their daily lives.

		Literature review

	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		We started with literature reviews of data from visual impairment 
		organizations such as Korean Blind Union. We focused on next three things to
		discover visually impaired people's behavior:
		<br><br>
		<li>Needs for traveling and difficulties in using public transportation</li>
		<li>Assistive technology for the visually impaired people's travel</li>
		<li>Limitations of applications based on Bus Information Service (BIS)</li>

		Design Implication
	</div>
	
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		We designed a new way of communication between visually impaired people and their 
		surroundings; a communication between a portable device and public data recorded on 
		the The elements that compose our system include the following: smartphone, white cane 
		with vibration motor and radio frequency identification (RFID) reader, passive 
		RFID-planted braille blocks, and communication system between user and bus driver. 
		Before elaborating the proposed design solution, we will first describe how each 
		instrument works.
		<br><br>
		<h4>White cane</h4>
		We tried to meliorate the current situation through the widely used apparatus, 
		a white cane. This is because it is inadvisable to require extra effort due to other 
		unfamiliar items. To most of the visually impaired, a white cane is an essential tool 
		that supports daily life. We adopt vibrations instead of sounds such as voice guidance, 
		which can hinder detection of obstacles through the sense of hearing. 
		This will prevent possible confusion caused by overlapped or reiterated feedback.

		At the tip of the cane, the RFID reader is implanted to read RFID chips buried in 
		braille roadblocks. The RFID chips contain location information that will be sent to 
		a smartphone once tagged by a white cane. Then, the smartphone speaks the information 
		to the user through earphones.

		<br><br> 


		<h4>Braille road block</h4>
		Braille blocks and a passive RFID chip were chosen, since braille blocks have strength 
		in their large establishment rate and wide usage and a passive RFID chip is durable 
		enough to be installed and operate well inside the blocks. 
		A passive RFID chip does not require a power source such as batteries, and it is able 
		to be manufactured as waterproof. Each RFID contains location information, such as street 
		names and the names of landmarks, to assist the users in finding the direction. 
		Those special braille blocks with built-in RFID can be installed on various significant 
		spots like crosswalks, building entrances, pedestrian overpasses, under passageways, 
		and bus stops.

		<h4>Communication system between bus drivers and users</h4>

			Communication Channel with Bus Driver<br>

		</div>
		Bus stops in Seoul give voice announcements telling the route numbers of incoming buses. 
		However, a problem arises when multiple buses arrive at the bus stop since visually 
		impaired users hardly recognize the right bus. Therefore, we propose a communication 
		system between bus drivers and users. Bus information system in Seoul, which is operated 
		by the Seoul city government, provides transit information including real-time bus 
		location using GPS on every bus. Now, every bus has a device to check the distance between 
		buses back and forth. Furthermore, drivers can communicate with dispatchers and other 
		drivers in order to keep buses on schedule. If people with visual impairment can employ 
		the system, they can send signals to a specific bus driver through an application. 
		Considering that one of the main concerns of bus usage is how to recognize the correct 
		boarding location among several buses, such mobile applications can be conducive to the 
		safe boarding of buses. By promoting communication between users and drivers with the 
		application, drivers can be more advertent of visually impaired passengers waiting at 
		the bus stop.

		First, users input their destination on the smartphone application. The input data 
		will be delivered through voice recognition technology since it is difficult for 
		visually impaired people to utilize a touch screen to type words into their phone. 

		Then, by using map data, the application suggests a recommended route including both 
		pedestrian paths and transportation transits. While walking on the pedestrian walkaways, 
		the user can use his or her own white cane in two ways. Firstly, as usual, users can 
		rely on his or her cane to avoid immediate obstacles in the way, for which application 
		guidance cannot be provide forewarning. The user follows braille roadblocks with his or 
		her white cane. 
		<br><br> 

		As it follows the braille roadblocks, the cane will operate the second 
		function; hitting braille roadblocks with this newly designed cane, an RFID reader at the 
		tip of the cane reads location information from RFID chips in roadblocks. Then, the white 
		cane sends location information to a smartphone. 
		<br><br> 

		When a user has to be informed of the exact direction or has to make a turn at the corner, 
		vibration motors in the handgrip tell users which direction to go, and how many degrees 
		to turn. Along with vibration, the user’s smartphone tells a few types of necessary 
		information to the user with voice: landmarks, the ends of each block, crosswalks, and 
		corners. Due to the process, users can find where they are and thus do not feel astray. 
		<br><br> 

		At the bus stop, the user waits for the right bus. When the user arrives at the bus stop 
		and tags the RFID chip with the white cane, a notification is sent to the bus driver. 
		<br><br> 

		When the bus arrives, it will make an audio signal from the front door so that the 
		blinded person can recognize distance and direction to the door.

		Conclusion
	</div>

	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		The unique contribution of TalkingCane is to combine shared public data with a white cane 
		to improve traveling experience of the visually impaired without introducing additional 
		gadgets. Our objective is to help visually impaired people take buses easily by increasing 
		accessibility. We conducted a literature review to find visually impaired people’s 
		difficulties in taking buses. 
		<br><br> 
		During the review, we discovered the need for communication 
		technology between visually impaired users and the world for a better traveling experience. 
		To establish the communication, a white cane and braille roadblocks were chosen as new 
		interactive devices. Many of our target user groups already use them in their daily lives. 
		The white cane was a great device to apply haptic feedback for terrain obstacles and become 
		an RFID reader as communication equipment.
