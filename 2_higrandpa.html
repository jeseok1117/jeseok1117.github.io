		Communication between Asian grandparents and their overseas grandchildren has been 
		impeded by an imbalance in technology adoption. We used a combined method of user 
		research, survey, and user-centered design to address this problem. Considering user 
		experience of two different end-users in this interaction process, we designed a 
		digital inbox connected with a mobile application as a final design. We intended to 
		increase communication frequency between family members, and also to cross between 
		traditional media and current technology, as well as cultures.

		Contextual Inquiry and Survey
	</div>
	
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		As preliminary research, we tried to figure out several questions based on our 
		target group—overseas Asian students and young employees. <br><br>
		<ol>
			<li>How does our target user group communicate with their grandparents? </li>
			<li>In what type of media (e.g. text, picture, video, audio call) do they want 
			to share when communicating?</li> 
			<li>What content (e.g. private story, positive experience, personal concern) 
			do they want to share with their grandparents?</li> 
			<li>Why do they communicate in this way?</li>	
		</ol>	
		<br>
		We found that their communication was significantly decreased after they had been 
		abroad. Because grandparents were not able to use social network or video talk 
		independently, grandchildren had to schedule a special time considering heavy course 
		load and time lag (only 35.7% of grandparents can use smartphones when they 
		communicate with grandchildren).<br><br>
		Grandchildren tended to convey selected information to their grandparents. They 
		preferred to share positive information and experiences (66.7% of grandchildren 
		don’t want to say “Life in the US is going in an unexpected direction, totally 
		out of control. I feel I’ve lost my direction. What can I do?” and 94.4% would not 
		tell them if they “drank until dawn last night,” while 76.7% of them would tell if 
		they received a full academic scholarship. What grandchildren wanted to hear from 
		grandparents would be comparatively limited and mostly health related: 90% said they 
		would be inclined to ask about grandparent’s health condition, while only 56.7% were 
		curious about their daily life, hobbies and activities and 53.3% were interested in 
		their life experiences.
		<br><br>
		Based on these results, we designed a survey and gathered 30 samples from the target 
		group, including grandchildren from China, Korea and Taiwan who were studying abroad 
		in the U.S. (age range of 18~29). We wanted to reassure that results we found in 
		contextual inquiry were replicable in entire target groups and found device usage 
		situations for both grandchildren and grandparents. Findings influencing our final 
		design are:
		<br><br>
		<ol>
		<li>There is no convenient way for grandchildren to share pictures with grandparents 
		when they are abroad: 76.7% of grandchildren are using audio calls for communication 
		with grandparents, and only 3.3% were using social networking services, and they would 
		like to share this visual information even more than mere stories (93.1% of grandchildren 
		answered that they wanted to share “pictures of thanksgiving dinner with friends” and 
		89.7% of them want to share “pictures of travel during term break” while 80% of them 
		would tell them that “I visited a sightseeing place during term break.”).</li>
		<li>Grandparents have difficulty learning high-tech devices, such as smartphones and 
			tablets. Interviewee A said, “it is useless to learn such devices at my age.” 
			However, those devices are the main channel that grandchildren use when 
			communicating in their daily lives.</li>
		<li>Personal choice of information as communication content varies.</li>

		Digital Prototype and User Testing
	</div>
	
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		Since this is a tool to connect two different side of grandparents and children,
		we had to design and test at the both ends.
		<br><br>
		<h4>Grandparent Part</h4>
		We had to conduct intensive user research on the user group since the user group 
		includes elderlies who are not accustomed to newer technology. We recruited 4 elderly 
		people to conduct user tests on the device used in the grandparents’ part. We built a 
		mockup to test usability in as similar of environment as possible. The mockup was 
		given to our participants, and they were asked to freely interact with it. By 
		monitoring their interaction with the mockup, we could decide the form and function 
		of our device. It will be discussed more in the final design part.

		<h4>Grandchildren’s part</h4>
		With our low-fidelity prototype, we conducted 5 user tests on the grandchildren’s part. 
		Based on a paper prototype test using a think-aloud method, we could organize the flow 
		of the application. In follow-up interviews, we could find users’ needs to share not only 
		their post on SNS but also create meta-data that they can provide. Moreover, users felt 
		that their expression was limited because specific emotions they wanted to share with 
		their grandparents were not uploaded on their timeline. We added features to upload data, 
		such as locations, maps, and weather. Also, we let users write their own text messages on 
		their newspaper.

			For better understanding and convenience, it should require minimum operation when 
			interacting. We thought of adopting a scanner on our device, but it turned out to be 
			hard for users to operate the device. Instead, a camera is put on the top of the device 
			to capture the image of the reply paper.
			<br><br>
			The second thing we considered is that its maintenance should be easy for the elderly.
			We had to reduce difficulty of maintenance in our device to make it user-friendly. 
			The paper tray on the top is designed to be a place to put papers, and its vertical 
			design lets users put in papers easily 
			<br><br>
			<h4>Grandchildren’s Part</h4>
			The application is comprised of four menus - Publish, History, Message Box, and Settings. 
			Publish menu includes Selecting feeds, Adding and Editing posts, and Publishing the paper. 
			In adding a post menu, users can select the type of data they want to input - plain text, 
			picture, camera, map, location information, and weather. Users can review their newspaper 
			in the History section. After they receive a reply from their grandparents, it can be found 
			in the Message Box section. In settings, users can figure out which SNS accounts should be 
			registered to the application, and decide a destination for their newspaper

			Benefits and conclusion

		<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
			Our design can help increase communication quality and frequency between grandparents and 
			grandchildren who are in different countries. With the new device, grandparents can have a 
			personal perspective on the culture and life of another country through the lives of their 
			grandchildren. By sharing life stories with their grandparents, international students can 
			strengthen their emotional connection with their grandparents. The two generations and two 
			cultural backgrounds are connected in this process, and most importantly, the “voice” of 
			international elderly people can be heard to the other side of the world.		
			<br><br> 
			Our design provides a two-way sharing between grandchildren and grandparents and finds a 
			way for grandparents to share their opinions and stories using a device they are 
			comfortable with. Without actually learning computers or smartphones, the communication 
			device we developed for elderly people contains respect for their traditional living 
			habits, and at the same time, combines technology and tradition.
