		SI 501 is a project-based course that students should work with a business client
		during the whole semester. My team worked with <a href="http://lhs.medicine.umich.edu/education/mhpe">UM MHPE(Master of
		Health Professions Education</a>, where doctors, nurses and other health professionals 
		learn how to educate future members of their professions â€“ and address the worldwide 
		shortage of many types of health care providers.

		Contextual Inquiry
	</div>
	
	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		We have conducted 6 contextual inquiries with users and stakeholders in UM MHPE.
		It includes on/off-campus students, professors, and school administrators. We visited
		the place where they work or study to acquire most from the interview process.
		In addition to interview, we could probe out their environment where interaction happens.

	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		Mentors in UM MHPE are basically researchers, and are also working for external clinic
		 as well. In our contextual inquiry with one of mentors, she identified herself as a 
		 researcher. Her office is located in Ann arbor, but she also works in a clinic in 
		 Detroit. In addition, she has to guide her two mentees regularly. To sum up, they have 
		 three other jobs at the same time. Based on the idea that they have different work place 
		 and different influencers, I would like to analyze their job experience by employing 
		 cultural model, and identify which influences they receive from and push back to each 
		 cultural influencer.
		<br><br>
		In that sense, I draw two big area of culture: UM MHPE Culture and Clinic Service Culture. 
		Each area represents the field the user belongs to. Thus, Mentee, Program Managers, and 
		Committee are important influencers in UM MHPE Culture area. In Clinic Service area, 
		Patients are the most important influencer. Among several influencers, I grouped them 
		to show relatedness of them if they belong to same group. Two couples of big blue arrows 
		are influence that each Culture area gives to influencers and user. Small arrows represent 
		influence and push back happening between the user and influencers.

		In the flow model, I illustrated communication flow across the user and the people 
		coordinating with the user. In case of UM MHPE, mentors mainly communicate with mentees 
		and program managers. While interacting with mentee, they receive support from material 
		experts and writing experts. In addition, they receive important information from committee
		 if something happens.
		<br><br>
		To illustrate the relationship of mentor and mentee, there is no concept of course or class 
		in UM MHPE. Educational professional activities(EPA) is the curriculum that mentees have to 
		accomplish, and it is composed of series of writing assignments about each topic. Mentees are 
		supposed to be able to select a topic and conduct individual research on that. What mentors do 
		for mentees is helping them out to finish these assignments. Much of communication between 
		mentor and mentee is conducted through in person meeting. Otherwise, they use e-mail to 
		schedule meeting, send files, and ask urgent question.  
		<br><br>
		If there is a need for additional help about academic resource or scientific writing, 
		mentors can request material experts or writing experts to help their mentee. They are 
		people who are hired for that specific purpose in the program.
		<br><br>		
		After a mentee finishes the assignment, it will be notified to committee and going to be 
		assessed by them. Result of the assignment will be sent both to mentee and his/her mentor. 
		<br><br>
		In this program, CTools is used as the most important source and archive of information. 
		Unlike usual CTools website consists as units of courses, UM MHPE has only one CTools 
		website for the whole program. Our interviewee mentioned that there are individual 
		sections categorized by each mentor. Every participant also uses CTools as a storage 
		for academic resource or assignment progress file. M+Box is also used for storing big 
		files or creating link to a file which should be accessible to people outside the university.

		Final Report

	<div id = "Container" class = "container description">
		Our final report includes 5 findings about UM MHPE and addresses long/short term solution
		to each problem.
		<br><br>
		<h4>Findings</h4>
		<li> Learners do not know where information about the program and administrative processes are stored</li>
		<li> Information does not consistently flow between committees and mentors</li>
		<li> Learners have inconsistent access to content experts and committees</li>
		<li> Learners rarely interact or share information between themselves</li>
		<li> A more comprehensive and organized content management system is needed for MHPE</li>
